Pineapple Proxy is a syndicate of decentralised entities who share members across the board.
We are all about cooperation and finding synergies in order to maximise our shared impact.

Like a well-mixed tropical fruit salad, the individuals who make up Pineapple Proxy each have a mysterious mix of skills, depth, and worldly insight. From hackers and writers to activists, strategists, programmers and artists (and a few hidden talents). These individuals make it a dream to collaborate with, especially since everyone has insight into various social movements and industries that span across privacy technology.

At this stage of maturity we have semi-formalised governance based on circles of trust, which we'll gradually evolve into a decentralised on-chain model.

Our team is distributed, self-organising and culturally diverse.
We come from all around the world: 🇨🇭🇩🇪🇨🇿🇭🇺🇮🇷🇦🇺🇺🇦🇦🇹🇵🇹🇪🇸🇺🇸
- Community members (conversation participants) = 32
- Certfied fresh fruits (🍍POAP holders) = 13
- Temporary governance members in trusted setup phase = 5


First phase of 🍍- Trust based value flows (this is where we are)

1) Pineapple Citadelle - BTC multisig acting as the 🍍 foundation. 
Responsible for on-chain value flows, grants, contracts and payments

1) Pineapple Express - A legal wrapper set up as an EU LLC.
Responsible for FIAT billing and value flows and old-world payments.

This already enables us to contract for work both with the old and new world. We believe that having both feet on the ground in two realities, this model might be one vessel for resilient, post capitalist ways of working.

Second phase 🍍🍍 - Trustless, on-chain setup - to enable decentralised governance and automated resource allocaiton & payment flows

5) Milestone 1 (Q2 '23): DAO on nyx - A jointly operated nym mixnet gateway, with zkynm integration, treasury and on-chain goverance solution using coconut credentials - zkynm.
5) Milestone 2 (Q2 '23): Set up a Wyoming DAO LLC from the nyx DAO multisig - closing the circle both in FIAT and crypto value realms. 
5) Milestone 3 (Q3 '23): Launch shared fedimint gateway

In the meantime we are actively working on DAO proposal structures, researching L1 & L2 privacy enchanced smart-chain based governance solutions, and bitcoin ordinals for BTC governance.
